Let's get started with this project.

These are some things you need to install to kick start your journey.

==========================
** Step 1: Install Node.js and npm **
==========================

Download the LTS version of Node.js from the official website:
Go to https://nodejs.org/
Download the installer for your operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux).
Run the installer and follow the instructions.

After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
node -v # Check Node.js version
npm -v  # Check npm version (Node Package Manager)

If the versions are displayed, Node.js and npm are installed successfully.

Step 2: Create a New React Application

Use the following command to create a new React application:
The `npx` command is used to create a new React app without installing anything globally.
npx create-react-app my-app

Note: Replace 'my-app' with your preferred project name.

Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
cd my-app

Step 4: Start the React Development Server

Start the development server to run the React app locally.
npm start

This command will automatically open your app in the browser at http://localhost:3000.
Your React application is now running!

Step 5: Install Additional Packages (Optional)

To install additional packages or libraries for your React app, use npm.
For example, to install React Router for navigation:
npm install react-router-dom

Or to install Axios for making HTTP requests:
npm install axios

Step 6: Build the Application for Production (When Ready)

When you're ready to deploy your app, you can create a production build using:
npm run build

This will optimize your app and create a 'build' folder ready for deployment.

Step 7: Run Tests (Optional)

If you want to run tests for your React app:
npm test

==========================
** Step 2: Download Maven **
==========================

 Go to the official Maven download page:
 https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

 Download the latest "Binary zip archive" for Windows
 OR "tar.gz" file for macOS/Linux.

 Step 1: Extract Maven Files 

 Windows:
- Extract the downloaded .zip file to a folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven)

macOS/Linux:
- Open Terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded Maven.
 - Run the following command to extract:
tar -xvzf apache-maven-*.tar.gz -C /opt/

Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Windows:
- Open "System Properties" → "Advanced" → "Environment Variables".
- Under "System Variables", find "Path" and add:
 C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\bin

 macOS/Linux:
- Open Terminal and edit your shell profile file (.bashrc, .zshrc, or .bash_profile):
nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for macOS
- Add the following lines at the end of the file:
export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-<version>
export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH
- Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
- Apply changes:
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for macOS

Step 4: Verify Installation
Open a new terminal or command prompt and run:
mvn -version

# Expected output:
# Apache Maven X.X.X (version number)
# Maven home: /path/to/maven
# Java version: X.X.X, vendor: Oracle Corporation
# 
# If you see the above details, Maven is installed successfully!
